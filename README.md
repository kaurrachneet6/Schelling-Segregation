# Schelling-Segregation
This repository contains variants of Schelling Segregation model created during my summer internship at Université Paris I, coded in MATLAB

The work is divided in 4 chapters discussing di erent variants of Schelling segregation models.
In chapter 1, the model where the  fixed switching agents are introduced at random locations in the initial grid is discussed and the plots are recreated concluding that the mixity of the system enhances as these type of agents were introduced in the system.
Chapter 2 discusses the e ect of introduction of  fixed agents inside a  fixed annular ring and outer of the circle and in Chapter 3, fixed agents are placed randomly in a gaussian ring and the effects are noted specifically comparing the tolerance level at which complete mixity is attained in this case with the one in standard Schelling dynamics shows that this kind of allocation introduces complete mixity in the grid at a much lower tolerance.
